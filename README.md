# Wallmart-project

## Project Objective 

The objective of the analysis is to provide the retail store with actionable insights and predictive models to address the following key questions regarding their inventory management and sales performance: 

1.	Assess the impact of unemployment rate on weekly sales and identify stores most affected by it. 
2.	Determine if there are seasonal trends in weekly sales and understand the reasons behind them. 
3.	Investigate the relationship between temperature and weekly sales. 
4.	Analyse how the Consumer Price Index (CPI) affects weekly sales across various stores.  
5.	Identify top-performing stores based on historical data.  
6.	Identify the worst-performing store and quantify the difference between the highest and lowest performing stores. 

The objective includes developing predictive models to forecast sales for each store for the next 12 weeks, utilizing advanced statistical and machine learning techniques. These forecasts will enable the store to optimize inventory management, allocate resources effectively, and make informed decisions to enhance overall business performance and profitability. 

## Data Description 

The dataset "walmart.csv" consists of 6435 rows and 8 columns. Here's a description of each feature: 
1.	Store: This column indicates the store number where the sales data was recorded. 
2.	Date: Represents the week of sales for each observation. 
3.	Weekly Sales: Indicates the sales for the given store in the specified week. 
4.	Holiday Flag: A binary indicator (0 or 1) representing whether it is a holiday week. If it is a holiday week, the value is 1; otherwise, it is 0. 
5.	Temperature: Denotes the temperature on the day of the sale, typically in Fahrenheit or Celsius. 
6.	Fuel Price: Represents the cost of fuel in the region where the store is located. 
7.	CPI (Consumer Price Index): Provides a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. 
8.	Unemployment: Indicates the unemployment rate for the specified week. 
This dataset can be utilized for various analyses, including but not limited to: 
•	Understanding the sales trends of different stores over time. 
•	Investigating the impact of holidays on sales. 
•	Exploring correlations between sales and external factors such as temperature, fuel prices, CPI, and unemployment rate. 
With this dataset, we can perform exploratory data analysis, build predictive models to forecast sales, and derive actionable insights to optimize inventory management and business strategies for the retail stores.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the implementation of the SARIMA model for forecasting weekly sales in the Walmart project has provided valuable insights and actionable recommendations for the retail business. Through the comprehensive analysis of historical sales data and external factors such as holidays, temperature, and economic indicators, the SARIMA model has demonstrated its effectiveness in capturing seasonal patterns, trends, and fluctuations in sales behaviour. 
The SARIMA model's ability to generate accurate forecasts has empowered the retail business to optimize inventory management, allocate resources efficiently, and develop targeted marketing strategies to drive sales growth and maximize profitability. By leveraging the insights provided by the SARIMA model, the business can make informed decisions, anticipate market trends, and adapt to changing consumer preferences, thereby gaining a competitive edge in the retail industry. 
Moving forward, continuous monitoring and refinement of the SARIMA model, along with the exploration of advanced forecasting techniques and integration with other business processes, will further enhance its predictive accuracy and reliability. By embracing the capabilities of the SARIMA model and addressing its limitations, the retail business can position itself for longterm success and sustainable growth in the dynamic marketplace. 
In essence, the SARIMA model represents an asset for the Walmart project, offering a datadriven approach to sales forecasting and strategic decision-making that empowers the business to thrive in an increasingly competitive retail landscape.
